# Siamese Networks

## Introduction
Learn about Siamese networks, a special type of neural network made of two identical networks that are eventually merged together, then build your own Siamese network that identifies question duplicates in a dataset from Quora.

## Learning Objectives
* One shot learning
* Triplet loss
