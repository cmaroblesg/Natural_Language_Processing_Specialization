# [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](./https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp/home/info)
***by DeepLearning.AI***

## About this Course
In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:

a) Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
b) Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
c) Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
d) Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!

This Specialization is designed and taught by two experts in NLP, machine learning, and deep learning. Younes Bensouda Mourri is an Instructor of AI at Stanford University who also helped build the Deep Learning Specialization. Łukasz Kaiser is a Staff Research Scientist at Google Brain and the co-author of Tensorflow, the Tensor2Tensor and Trax libraries, and the Transformer paper.

## Syllabus
### [**Week 1** Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis](./Week1/README.md)
Learn about neural networks for deep learning, then build a sophisticated tweet classifier that places tweets into positive or negative sentiment categories, using a deep neural network.

### [**Week 2** Recurrent Neural Networks for Language Modeling](./Week2/README.md)
Learn about the limitations of traditional language models and see how RNNs and GRUs use sequential data for text prediction. Then build your own next-word generator using a simple RNN on Shakespeare text data!

### [**Week 3** LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition](./Week3/README.md)
Learn about how long short-term memory units (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient problem, and how Named Entity Recognition systems quickly extract important information from text. Then build your own Named Entity Recognition system using an LSTM and data from Kaggle!

### [**Week 4** Siamese Networks](./Week4/README.md)
Learn about Siamese networks, a special type of neural network made of two identical networks that are eventually merged together, then build your own Siamese network that identifies question duplicates in a dataset from Quora.
