# LSTMs and Named Entity Recognition

## Introduction
Learn about how long short-term memory units (LSTMs) solve the vanishing gradient problem, and how Named Entity Recognition systems quickly extract important information from text. Then build your own Named Entity Recognition system using an LSTM and data from Kaggle!

## Learning Objectives
* Vanishing gradients
* Named entity recognition
* LSTMs
* Feature extraction
* Part-of-speech tagging
* Data generators
